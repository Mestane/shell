// Small always-on-top-center pill that pops up briefly whenever the playing
// track changes (replacing the plain "now playing" toast), showing a mini
// visualiser plus cover/title. Hovering it peeks the Dashboard's Media tab
// (rather than duplicating that UI here) and restores whatever dashboard
// state was there before the peek once the cursor leaves.
//
// It follows whatever has something to say about what is playing - an MPRIS
// player, or the in-shell player - by the same rule the media tab uses to pick
// its source: with no external player open, the local player is what the pill
// is there for.
